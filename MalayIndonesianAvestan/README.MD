What would Indonesian/Malay look like if it were written in the Avestan script? It would look like this.
Write "e pepet" (schwa) as "e" and "e taling" as "é" (Example: merdeka → merdéka), replace "q" with "k" (Example: quran → kuran), and "x" to "ks" or "s" depending on position (Example: axolotl → aksolotl, xenofobia → senofobia).
